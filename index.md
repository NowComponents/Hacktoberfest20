# Contributing to Now Components

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to Now Component Catalog. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

The Now Component Catalog is an open source project supported by the efforts of an entire community and built one contribution at a time by users like you. We'd love for you to get involved. Whatever your level of skill or however much time you can give, your contribution is greatly appreciated. There are many ways to contribute, from submitting bug reports and feature requests, helping other users by commenting on issues, or writing code which can be incorporated into site itself or **adding new components to the catalog**.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

# How this project is structured

1.  Now Components need their own Scope in ServiceNow.  You can only have one scope in a repository, as such, this repository will act as catalog of those other repositories.
2.  Because we want these components available for the foreseeable future, this [organziation](https://github.com/nowcomponents) will have all the repositories.  
  - To get a repository in this organization, log an issue or comment on an issue that you want to build that specific component.
  - Once a repository is made, [fork it](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
  - In your fork, follow the [flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
  - When it's working properly, [make a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) to the original repo in this organization
  - Additionally, make a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/NowComponents/nowcomponents.github.io) and add details about the component.  You should minimally have a screenshot of it, a description, if relevant, a code snippet to call it.
3.  You will be contacted by a maintainer to figure out swag.
