[todo](https://github.com/NowComponents/todo) - Todo component that works with the [Simple Todo]() app. Someone please make it look nicer...

This is a fairly barebones todo list component that uses the httpEffect, input, buttons, and a subcomponent to build a (not very pretty) todo list. You can create new, complete, and cancel todos from the component.

The component works with a simple todo list app found here: github.com/bradtiltonnow/simple-todo.

My goal for this component was to create something that works with lots of opportunities for enhancements, so check the issues for enhancement ideas or add some of your own.
